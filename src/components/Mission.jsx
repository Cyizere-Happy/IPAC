                    The clear confidence gap between men and women isn't just a feeling—it's a systemic barrier.
                    At <span className="text-primary font-bold">Resonate</span>, we are dedicated to dismantling this gap through mentorship,
                    community, and actionable resources. We believe that when women resonate with their own power, the world changes.
